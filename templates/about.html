    After <strong>25 years working in technology</strong> as the go-to translator between technical and non-technical teams, I decided to dive deeper and <strong>learn to code</strong>. My passion for understanding how technology works drives me to create meticulous, detail-oriented solutions while working collaboratively with others. I hold a Master’s in Strategic Technology Management, which has given me a strong foundation in <strong>aligning technology with business strategy</strong>. I’m enrolled in the #100Devs software engineering training program, where I’m honing my skills in <strong>full-stack development</strong> and building <strong>real-world projects</strong>.

    While I have experience managing projects and <strong>bridging communication gaps</strong> between stakeholders, I thrive most when I’m involved with the technical details—<strong>solving problems</strong>, <strong>building systems</strong>, and <strong>making things work seamlessly</strong>. I’m driven by curiosity and a desire to master the intricacies of software development. I enjoy being part of teams where I can contribute my skills, <strong>collaborate effectively</strong>, and make an impact by creating solutions that align with both technical and business needs.
